In (Lawrence, G. Michailidis, and V. N. Nair, 2006.) a probe path allocation scheme for tree based topologies is introduced. This focuses on decomposition of the system into mutliple sub-networks, this grouping is done for an arbitrary graph topology in (M. Rahali, J.-M. Sanner, G. Rubino, 2019) maximizing the number of shared links between the paths inside each sub-network, and minimizing the number of links in each onesub-network. This is done using a distance based clustering algorthim, forming clusters with the most similar distances. combining k-means and a recursive DFS solver to find possible ones. An Expectation-Maximization ((Lawrence, G. Michailidis, and V. N. Nair, 2006.) (Deng, Li, Zhu, Geng, Liue, 2012)) algorithm is then used to asses these clusters for the optimal one. (M. Rahali, J.-M. Sanner, G. Rubino, 2019) also introduces an optimized version of k-paths, Evolutionary Sampling Algorithm (ESA).

Another approach by (He, 2018) formulates a Greedy Measurement Design (GMD) algothim to select optimal P. The paper uses citation and proves that this is a class of matroid optimization problem and can be solved using related techniques. This technique has a time complexity of the order O(|Z|^2 log |Z|) where Z = the set of monitors, to sort the set of paths and O(|Z|^2|L|^3) to build optimal P. Resulting in a total complexity of O(|Z|^3|L|^3).
