	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01734},
	abstract = {The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative computational method to calculate the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) from the sample data. It converts a complicated one-time calculation for the MLE of the incomplete data to a series of relatively simple calculations for the MLEs of the complete data. When the MLE is available, we naturally want the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of unknown parameters. The FIM is, in fact, a good measure of the amount of information a sample of data provides and can be used to determine the lower bound of the variance and the asymptotic variance of the estimators. However, one of the limitations of the EM is that the FIM is not an automatic by-product of the algorithm. In this paper, we review some basic ideas of the EM and the FIM. Then we construct a simple Monte Carlo-based method requiring only the gradient values of the function we obtain from the E step and basic operations. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and numerical examples to show the efficiency of our method. The key part of our method is to utilize the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation method to approximate the Hessian matrix from the gradient of the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function. Key words: Fisher information matrix, EM algorithm, Monte Carlo, Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation},

	doi = {10.1109/TSP.2015.7296272},
	abstract = {With the advent of online social media, latency became a primary factor and large Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers optimize their networks for. While many ingredients (e.g. propagation delay, transmission delay, processing delay) of the end-to-end latency can be adequately characterized, capturing queuing delay seems to be a difficult task due to the complex and often unpredictable nature of Internet paths and the imperfect tools used for measurements. Dealing with the queuing delay is so challenging that most papers concerning end-to-end latency completely ignore it for ‚Äúsimplicity‚Äù. In this paper we take this view to the extreme and try to interpret the cause of various delays between the same endpoints as measurement artifacts, such as continuous changes in end-to-end paths and the imperfection of measurement tools. We arrive to the conclusion that there is a significant amount of points in end-to-end delay measurements, which cannot be explained by these artifacts even if we do our best for doing so. The only plausible explanation for these points is the presence of significant queuing delay comparable with the delay caused by all the other factors (propagation, transmission and processing).},

	abstract = {Networks are everywhere and their many types, including social networks, the Internet, food webs etc., have been studied for the last few decades. However, in real-world networks, it‚Äôs hard to find examples that can be easily comparable, i.e. have the same density or even number of nodes and edges. We propose a flexible and extensible NetSim framework to understand how properties in different types of networks change with varying number of edges and vertices. Our approach enables to simulate three classical network models (random, small-world and scale-free) with easily adjustable model parameters and network size. To be able to compare different networks, for a single experimental setup we kept the number of edges and vertices fixed across the models. To understand how they change depending on the number of nodes and edges we ran over 30,000 simulations and analysed different network characteristics that cannot be derived analytically. Two of the main findings from the analysis are that the average shortest path does not change with the density of the scale-free network but changes for small-world and random networks; the apparent difference in mean betweenness centrality of the scale-free network compared with random and small-world networks.},
