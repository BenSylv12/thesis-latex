	abstract = {Abstract While often confused, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the Smirnov test are actually distinct. Specifically, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is used to test the goodness of fit of a given set of data to a theoretical distribution, making this a one-sample test. In contrast, the Smirnov test is a two-sample test, used to determine if two samples appear to follow the same distribution. The intuition behind the two tests is the same, however, in that both compare cumulative distribution functions, either two empirical cumulative distribution functions for the two-sample Smirnov test, or one empirical cumulative distribution function and one known cumulative distribution function for the one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.},

	url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804517303569},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jnca.2017.10.016},
	abstract = {Context
One of the main targets of cyber-attacks is data exfiltration, which is the leakage of sensitive or private data to an unauthorized entity. Data exfiltration can be perpetrated by an outsider or an insider of an organization. Given the increasing number of data exfiltration incidents, a large number of data exfiltration countermeasures have been developed. These countermeasures aim to detect, prevent, or investigate exfiltration of sensitive or private data. With the growing interest in data exfiltration, it is important to review data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures to support future research in this field.
Objective
This paper is aimed at identifying and critically analysing data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures for reporting the status of the art and determining gaps for future research.
Method
We have followed a structured process for selecting 108 papers from seven publication databases. Thematic analysis method has been applied to analyse the extracted data from the reviewed papers.
Results
We have developed a classification of (1) data exfiltration attack vectors used by external attackers and (2) the countermeasures in the face of external attacks. We have mapped the countermeasures to attack vectors. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of various countermeasures for different states of data (i.e., in use, in transit, or at rest).
Conclusion
This review has revealed that (a) most of the state of the art is focussed on preventive and detective countermeasures and significant research is required on developing investigative countermeasures that are equally important; (b) Several data exfiltration countermeasures are not able to respond in real-time, which specifies that research efforts need to be invested to enable them to respond in real-time (c) A number of data exfiltration countermeasures do not take privacy and ethical concerns into consideration, which may become an obstacle in their full adoption (d) Existing research is primarily focussed on protecting data in ‘in use’ state, therefore, future research needs to be directed towards securing data in ‘in rest’ and ‘in transit’ states (e) There is no standard or framework for evaluation of data exfiltration countermeasures. We assert the need for developing such an evaluation framework.},

In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing the probing cost and achieving identifiability in probe-based network link monitoring. Given a set of links to monitor, our objective is to select the minimum number of probing paths that can uniquely determine all identifiable links and cover all unidentifiable links. We propose an algorithm based on a linear system model to find out all irreducible sets of probing paths that can uniquely determine an identifiable link, and we extend the bipartite model to reflect the relationship between a set of probing paths and an identifiable link. Since our optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic-based algorithm to greedily select probing paths. Our method eliminates two types of redundant probing paths, i.e., those that can be replaced by others and those without any contribution to achieving identifiability. Simulations based on real network topologies show that our approach can achieve identifiability with very low probing cost. Compared with prior work, our method is more general and has better performance.},

	abstract = {The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative computational method to calculate the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) from the sample data. It converts a complicated one-time calculation for the MLE of the incomplete data to a series of relatively simple calculations for the MLEs of the complete data. When the MLE is available, we naturally want the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of unknown parameters. The FIM is, in fact, a good measure of the amount of information a sample of data provides and can be used to determine the lower bound of the variance and the asymptotic variance of the estimators. However, one of the limitations of the EM is that the FIM is not an automatic by-product of the algorithm. In this paper, we review some basic ideas of the EM and the FIM. Then we construct a simple Monte Carlo-based method requiring only the gradient values of the function we obtain from the E step and basic operations. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and numerical examples to show the efficiency of our method. The key part of our method is to utilize the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation method to approximate the Hessian matrix from the gradient of the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function.

Today, the inclusion of network theory into Cognitive Sciences, and the expansion of complex- systems science, promises to significantly change the way in which the organization and dynamics of cognitive and behavioral processes are understood. In this paper, we review recent contributions of network theory at different levels and domains within the Cognitive Sciences.},

	abstract = {With the advent of online social media, latency became a primary factor and large Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers optimize their networks for. While many ingredients (e.g. propagation delay, transmission delay, processing delay) of the end-to-end latency can be adequately characterized, capturing queuing delay seems to be a difficult task due to the complex and often unpredictable nature of Internet paths and the imperfect tools used for measurements. Dealing with the queuing delay is so challenging that most papers concerning end-to-end latency completely ignore it for “simplicity”. In this paper we take this view to the extreme and try to interpret the cause of various delays between the same endpoints as measurement artifacts, such as continuous changes in end-to-end paths and the imperfection of measurement tools. We arrive to the conclusion that there is a significant amount of points in end-to-end delay measurements, which cannot be explained by these artifacts even if we do our best for doing so. The only plausible explanation for these points is the presence of significant queuing delay comparable with the delay caused by all the other factors (propagation, transmission and processing).},

The proposed algorithm adopts null-space projection-based consensus among agents to ﬁnd individual entries from a set of arbitrary sumcumulative entities associated with graph edges (e.g., delays associated with edges) based on sums over the network paths. The local estimates of delay proﬁle are estimated using Least Squares (LS). A modiﬁed, tailored, iterative consensus algorithm is then employed to distribute information among the neighbors. The distributed network tomography is compared to the conventional centralized solution and also to iterative solvers based on Cimmino, CAV, and Landweber methods applied in a distributed manner.},

	abstract = {Networks are everywhere and their many types, including social networks, the Internet, food webs etc., have been studied for the last few decades. However, in real-world networks, it’s hard to find examples that can be easily comparable, i.e. have the same density or even number of nodes and edges. We propose a flexible and extensible NetSim framework to understand how properties in different types of networks change with varying number of edges and vertices. Our approach enables to simulate three classical network models (random, small-world and scale-free) with easily adjustable model parameters and network size. To be able to compare different networks, for a single experimental setup we kept the number of edges and vertices fixed across the models. To understand how they change depending on the number of nodes and edges we ran over 30,000 simulations and analysed different network characteristics that cannot be derived analytically. Two of the main findings from the analysis are that the average shortest path does not change with the density of the scale-free network but changes for small-world and random networks; the apparent difference in mean betweenness centrality of the scale-free network compared with random and small-world networks.},
