\chapter{Design and Methodology}
\label{cha:methodology}
In this chapter we present the tools and techniques used in our experimental analysis and detail their application. We partition our approach into three categories, each focused on addressing a particular section of our overarching hypothesis. Firstly in \cref{sec:Msimenvironment} we detail the network simulation environment, data sets, and produced tools. In this section we also give a high-level implementation overview of the network, probe paths, and other data structures.\par
Secondly in \cref{sec:Mnetworkprobing} we cover our approach to testing sub-hypothesis one, that network tomography enables inference of node level packet delay metrics within stochastically routing networks. Specifics of how network tomography has been applied and subsequently evaluated w.r.t its ability as a tool to inferring node level metrics are also given.\par
Thirdly in \cref{sec:MNefidentification} we give an overview of our approach to determining router level nefarious hold probability in . In this analysis we identify a novel parametric relationship between router hold probability and packet delay. We then show how this relationship can be inverted to estimate router hold probability from packet delay. Coupled with this we present a secondary approach which requires ground truth metrics of the network known to have no nefarious routers.\par
Finally in \cref{sec:Moptprobing} we segment the complex process of network tomography using a novel representation we refer to as the \textit{tomographic pipeline}. We then cover our implementation of two optimisations to the tomographic pipeline using techniques introduced in \cref{sec:Boptimization}.

\section{Simulation Environment and Tools}
\label{sec:Msimenvironment}
This section details network topology data sets, network traffic data generation, tools for analysis, and developed software packages for evaluation of our overarching hypothesis. Details of data used for real world network analysis are given in \cref{ssec:Mdatasets}. Alterations and additions to the data sets are addressed along with generation of traffic and probing data in \cref{ssec:Mdataprocessing}. Produced packages are listed in \cref{ssec:Msoftware} and implementation details for all classes and analysis scripts can be found in \cite{sylvester_millar_real_2021}.

\subsection{Data Sets}
\label{ssec:Mdatasets}
Real world topology data sets are from the SNDLib project (\cite{orlowski_sndlib_2007}) and the Internet Topology Zoo project (\cite{knight_internet_2011}). We have selected three national ISP topologies for analysis, details of these network are shown in \cref{tbl:Mrealnetworkattributes}. These topologies were selected as they have a high connectivity (without being fully connected) and large number of nodes (>15) compared to other typologies within the data set. We believe this combination represents real-world scenarios where network tomography can provide useful results with non-trivial performance improvements over conventional monitoring methods.\par
A synthetic 7 router network was also used for initial data exploration. A worked example of network tomography using this network and a diagram of the topology is provided in \cref{sec:Mnetworkprobing}.\par

\subsection{Data Processing}
\label{ssec:Mdataprocessing}
Data from both the SNDlib and Internet Topology Zoo projects are stored in a range of bespoke XML and GraphML formats. To maximise speed of the network simulation these formats were parsed into a graph object in the python iGraph library (\cite{csardi_igraph_2006}). Nodes and links from the topology data sets are represented as iGraph vertices and links respectively. All python objects were stored using python's pickle module \cite{van_rossum_python_2020}.\par
An object representing each network device (\textit{i.e. router or switch}) is stored as an attribute of each iGraph vertex along with an id to account for iGraph's dynamic object indexing. Each network device stores an array of packet received each timestep, shuffling and appending elements from this array to its queue buffer to emulate temporal ambiguity in receiving packets. As each packet is an instance of a UDP packet class once the buffer queue reaches capacity additional packets are silently dropped.\par
Despite best efforts network traffic data for systems with robustly mapped topologies and probabilistically delaying routers could not be acquired. Due to this traffic was generated at simulation run time from switches attached to routers. Each switch has a fixed probability of sending a packet with a random destination to its attached router every timestep. As the number of packets received by routers follows a Poisson distribution (see \cref{sssec:Itrafficsimulation}) the number of switches attached to each router is selected at random from the poisson class of numpy's random library.\par
UDP traffic is stochastically routed through the network using a link state (\textit{LS}) protocol. Link state advertisements are broadcast at the start of the simulation and the network is not probed for the first 5\% of the simulation to allow for the routing tables to stabilise. LS advertisements are sent periodically throughout the simulation with path weights to each router representing the sum of router buffer queue length on that path. Routers forward packets to the router with the lowest cumulative path weight.\par
CFR restricted probe paths between monitors are calculated using Zheng's path selection algorithm (see \cref{ssec:Bparsppselection}). Probe paths and linear equations for router identification are stored in a custom format (.dat files within \cite{sylvester_millar_real_2021}) and converted to binary vectors for use in analysis at simulation run time. Probe packet generation is halted before the last 10\% of simulation time to allow probe packets to reach their destination monitor. This emulates real world networks where run time would not be limited and probe packets would be able to traverse the network.\par
To generate robust results 100 subsets of routers are selected iid for each combinations of network attributes in each topology. Each of these sets contains a random number of routers to be designated as nefarious at simulation run time. As the network is stochastically routing all simulation results were then averaged over three 100,000 timestep simulations to minimize variance. All simulation and analysis was conducted on the NCI's Gadi super computer.\par

\subsection{Simulation and Analysis Software}
\label{ssec:Msoftware}
As a result of this work python scripts have been produced for the following functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parsing XML/GraphML to iGraph network objects.
    \item Simulating dynamically routing UDP traffic and CFR restricted probe traffic over arbitrary network topologies with nefarious routers.
    \item Parsing network tomography probe paths from and to a custom file format.
    \item Generating a minimal number of CFR restricted probe paths and linear equations to identify router packet delay metrics.
    \item Computing an allocation of probe packets over a set of probe paths to maximise information gain from network tomography.
    \item Optimising set of probe paths selected and allocation of packets over those paths.
    \item Classifying nefarious routers under three different sets of assumptions on networking performance logging.
\end{itemize}
Jupyter notebooks were used for initial topology and traffic data exploration as well as visualisation of results. Python scripts were developed using Matplotlib (\cite{hunter_matplotlib_2007}) to produce confusion matrices and receiver operating characteristic plots for evaluation of our classifiers.

\section{Inferring Packet Delay Metrics}
\label{sec:Mnetworkprobing}
In this section we present our application of additive network tomography to the problem setting and motivations behind design decisions for our classifier. We introduce the implementation of probe paths and routing of probe packets. An exploratory analysis of a seven router network is conducted to give insight into the accuracy of network tomography and its dependence on the number of probe packets sent.\par
When the topology is parsed into iGraph a minimum subset of routers sufficient for router identifiability are designated as monitors using Ma's monitor placement algorithm. Probe paths between these monitors are then calculated using the Zheng's path selection algorithm (see \cref{ssec:Bparsppselection}).\par
Each probe path is converted to two directed probe paths to allow both monitors on the path to send packets along it. Each directed path is assigned a unique id which is included in the tag field of all probe packets sent along that path. At simulation start probe paths are broadcast from monitors to all routers. Routers store the subsequent router from them on the path as the forwarding destination for any probe packets they receive.\par

    \label{fig:M6routersample}
\end{figure}\par
The total number of probe packets sent from monitors during analysis can be varied within our simulation tool. We refer to this number of probe packets sent as \textit{probing intensity}. At the end of the simulation the timestep each packet was sent from and received by a monitor is aggregated to give a distribution of packet transmission delays along that path.\par
To validate the accuracy of tomographic probing in a nefarious settings we consider the six router network in \cref{fig:M6routersample}. The average of 50 simulations, each with a random set of nefarious routers, was taken over a range of probing intensities. The difference between inferred and true PDA was then averaged over all routers and results are presented in \cref{fig:MPDAvarprobing}. We note that a 2-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov test determined no significant difference in accuracy of PDA inference between nefarious and non-nefarious routers. For justification behind our use of the packet delay average see \cref{ssec:MPDMseclection}.

\end{figure}

\section{Packet Delay Metric Inference Validity}
\label{sec:MPDMinferencevalid}
To determine the validity of our core hypothesis that packet delay metrics enable classification of routers probabilistically delaying packets we again consider the six router network from \cref{fig:M6routersample}. To observe the impact of nefarious behaviour on packet delay six experiments were conducted with each router $r_0,\dots, r_5$ designed as nefarious in each experiment respectively.Each experiment consisted of 50 trials over range of holding probabilities for the nefarious router between 0 and 1, in each trial average packet delay statistics from 50 simulations were collected from each router every timestep post queue stabilization. Plots of router packet delay average (PDA) and variation (PDV) are shown in \cref{fig:Rvarnefrouter}.\par
Initially all nefarious router packet delay metrics were grouped together in the analysis but as shown in \cref{tbl:MrouterPDAvars} large variances in PDA, and consequently PDV, were observed in delay probabilities 0.2 - 0.5. Closer investigation revealed that this discrepancy of variances was between 3 groups of routers: $\{r_0,\ r_5\}$, $\{r_1,\ r_4\}$, and $\{r_2,\ r_3\}$ this grouping is validated by the table of variances in \cref{tab:Rallvars}.\par
From this we find that the intra-group variance is 100.60, 34.46, and 179.92 for each groups respectively however they have an average inter-group variance of 862.99. Each group has a common feature, that its comprising routers are indistinguishable via their values in the adjacency matrix. Using these grouping its clear that the nefarious router's PDA differs significantly from all other routers in the network, with a hold probability of 0.5 resulting in a router PDA $\approx$3232 times larger than that of the 2nd largest PDA.\par
Of interest is the behaviour of $r_0$ and $r_5$ when nefarious as although these routers connect to half as many routers as the others their nefarious behaviour can still be inferred through PDA. This relationship enforces our conclusion that PDA metrics allow for nefarious router identification. We note no routers in topologies from the SDNlib nor Internet Topology Zoo database routers are indistinguishable via their values in the adjacency matrix. We therefore do not consider the impact of this nefarious router PDA grouping in our analysis.\par
As expected when the nefarious router has a hold probability of 0 it PDV mimics that of a non-nefarious router. When the nefarious router has a very high hold probability $\gtrapprox 0.7$ we see again the PDV regress to that of the rest of the network corroborating analysis in \cref{ssec:MPDMseclection}.\par
We anticipate this behaviour is due to the use of variance as a metric, if a router is delaying all packets traversing it then its queue length will be consistently large or the queue will be completely full, varying little. If this hypothesis is true it follows that although the PDV decreases significantly over a nefarious holding probability of 0.7 the PDA would continue to increase. PDA measurements from the same experimental trials in \ref{fig:MrouterPDA} show a clear monotonic increase between PDA and holding probability, conforming to our expectations.

\section{Identifying Nefarious Behaviour}
\label{sec:MNefidentification}
  In our problem setting nefarious behaviour is characterized by a router probabilistically \textit{delaying} packets by not forwarding them during a timestep. As noted in previous chapters we refer to a router's probability of delaying a packet during a timestep as its \textit{hold probability}. To classify a router as behaving nefariously we require a metric that is impacted by this nefarious behaviour and identifiable using network tomography. In that packet delay, serving as a proxy for router buffer queue length, is an appropriate metric. We therefore hypothesise that a router can be classified as exhibiting nefarious behaviour using information gained from packet delay metrics.\par
  This section is divided into four sub-sections, the first address a design choice to use the PDA metric and the following three describe the methodology used in evaluating our nefarious router classifier. Subsection two and three specifically address how we classify nefariously behaving routers and subsection four how we compare these classifications. \cref{ssec:MTruevalues} covers approaches to classification using the true buffer queue length measurements from routers at simulation time. This is to test our underlying assumption that a routers buffer queue length is influenced by its hold probability. In \cref{ssec:MInferredvalues} we instead use packet delay averages from network tomography to classify routers as nefarious. Following this we present our approach to comparing the classifications using both inferred and true data sets under each case of assumptions.
  
  \subsection{Packet Delay Metric Selection}
  \label{ssec:MPDMseclection}
  Using path level packet delay distribution we compute path PDA and PDV with numpy (\cite{harris_array_2020}) vector operations. These metrics are substituted to each router identifiability equation to compute router level metrics.\par
  To determine whether use of PDA, PDV enable the most accurate inference of true router level metrics we consider the six router network in \cref{fig:M6routersample}. We note that a combination of these metrics may enable more accurate inference of hold probability but leave this to future work.\par
  As router queue buffer's contain a history of packets sent to it the length of the queue buffer determines how much packet information a router can hold. To account for this variable information in our analysis we take an average of router level PDA and PDV against hold probability from 50 simulations over a range of queue buffer lengths, results are shown in \cref{fig:RvariedqlenPDM}. Note that a router with a hold probability of 0.0 is analogous to a non-nefarious router.\par
  \begin{figure}
      \centering
      \begin{subfigure}{0.475\textwidth}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/results/qlen_fitting/qlen_PDA_lm.png}
          \caption{Packet Delay Average}
      \end{subfigure}
      \begin{subfigure}{0.475\textwidth}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/results/qlen_fitting/qlen_PDV_lm.png}
          \caption{Packet Delay Variation}
      \end{subfigure}
      \caption{Plots of router level PDA and PDV over various hold probabilities.}
      \label{fig:RvariedqlenPDM}
  \end{figure}
  From this we see that router level PDA and hold probability exhibit a monotonically increasing relationship. In comparison PDV for router queue lengths less than 5,000 reaches a maximum  after which it regresses back to 0. The hold probability which results in this maximum PDV is related to the router buffer queue length, with larger queue lengths causing the maximum PDV to occur at a greater hold probability. Both PDA and PDV values before this maximum follow a similar trend however for large hold probabilities PDA is far greater than PDV.\par
  This reduction in PDV for large hold probabilities is likely due to the router's buffer queue reaching saturation. Once full the queue length varies very little as even with stochastic routing the router will receive a small amount of packets. These packets are likely from either a connected switch or routers calculating a route contain the device has a shorter expected queuing delay than a longer route.\par
  As routers with very large hold probabilities have a higher chance of being nefarious their identification by any produced classifier is imperative. Due to this we have opted to use PDA metrics for our classifier of nefarious nodes.\par
  Additionally producing a function to fit the data points in this analysis a parametric relationship between router PDV and hold probability was identified. From our use of various buffer queue lengths a further relationship between buffer queue length and parameters of the optimally fitting function was observed. This spurred an investigation into the possibility of using this relationship to directly compute router hold probability using PDA and network parameters (\textit{i.e. buffer queue length, traffic intensity etc.}). We present this analysis in Appendix B and highlight this as an extremely promising avenue for further study.

  \subsection{Nefarious Node Classification}
  \label{ssec:MTruevalues}
  In testing our sub-hypothesis of identifying nefarious routers we construct three classifiers each under a different set of assumptions. Each subsequent set of assumptions reduces the amount of information available for router classification. The sets of assumptions for each classifier are:
  \begin{description}[labelindent=1cm]
      \item[Classifier 1:] Known router packet delay metrics with no nefarious routers (\textit{baseline metrics}) and complete distribution of router buffer queue length at each timestep.
      \item[Classifier 2:] Only known router packet delay metrics with no nefarious routers (\textit{baseline metrics}).
      \item[Classifier 3:] No additional assumptions.
  \end{description}
  The first set was chosen as it emulates a situation where network tomography yields perfectly accurate results. This serves as a test of whether we are able to accurately classify nefarious routers given full router level information.\par
  The second and third sets emulate scenarios where results from network tomographic analysis presented in \cref{sec:Mnetworkprobing} are used for calculation. The second set additionally emulates an system under constant network monitoring. In this scenario metrics with no nefarious routers can be viewed as logged system metrics. The third set represents a scenario where these previous logs are not available or a new system is being analysed.\par
  For classifiers one and two we run additional simulations of each topology with no nefarious routers to serve as baseline metrics. We compute the mean of all metrics from these simulations, using these as the baseline metrics. With these baseline metrics and results from 500 blind trials with nefarious routers under each assumption set we detail how each classifier labels nefarious nodes below in turn, beginning with classifier one.\par
  In assumption case one we have two distributions of buffer queue lengths for each router with only one known to have been collected from a non-nefarious router. To classify if a router is nefarious using these we assume that a nefariously delaying router will have buffer queue lengths greater than an equivalent non-nefariously delaying router.\par
  To compare these distributions we use SciPy's implementation of a one-tailed two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (\cite{chakravarti_handbook_1967}) in python. To ensure the classification is accurate we select a p-value of 0.0 as required to label a router as nefarious. This means we tolerate virtually no chance of the result occurring by chance. We select this extremely low tolerance as our assumptions in this test provide the most information possible. To give a more comprehensive overview of classifier one we produce a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, varying the p-val required to be classified as nefarious.\par
  In assumption case two we do not have access to the complete queue buffer length distributions. Instead we use utilise summary statistics obtainable from tomography, specifically PDA and PDV. Without the underlying distribution we are unable to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as in classifier one. It follows from our assumption in case one that their will be a statistically significant difference in PDA between a nefarious and non-nefarious router.\par
  To account for differences due to noise from stochastic routing we use a standard deviation test for outliers. This test is shown in \cref{eq:stddev} where: $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and variance of the absolute differences between the baseline and potentially nefarious simulation for all routers, X is the given routers difference from baseline results, and Z is the threshold for being classified nefarious. As in classifier one we vary the threshold for a node to be labeled as nefarious and present the results using a ROC curve.\par
  
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:stddev}
      \frac{\mu-X}{\sigma}>z
  \end{equation}
  
  In the most restrictive scenario of case three we have access to neither the underlying router buffer queue distribution nor a baseline of non-nefarious metrics. We therefore use PDA alone to label a router as nefarious, varying the PDA threshold required and again present results using a ROC curve.\par
  
  \subsection{Classification with Inferred Values}
  \label{ssec:MInferredvalues}
  We combine methods from \cref{sec:Mnetworkprobing} and \cref{sec:MNefidentification} to evaluate our overarching hypothesis that network tomography can be used to identify nefarious routers. This is analogous to cases 2 and 3 from \cref{ssec:MTruevalues}, where summary statistics of router queue lengths are used to classify routers as nefarious. Case 1 is not applicable as the use of an underlying true distribution of router buffer queue lengths can not be obtained with tomography. We cover our method for testing the efficacy of PDA inferred through network tomography as a metric used in identifying nefarious routers firstly under assumption case 2 then 3.\par
  In assumption case 2 where the baseline PDA of each router is known we use the same methods as in \cref{ssec:MTruevalues} to assess if the router is nefarious. From network tomography we have the PDA at each router, analogous to the router's buffer queue length. We then compute the difference between the PDA of the baseline simulation and the simulation with unknown nefarious routers for each router in the network. We use a standard deviation test (\cref{eq:stddev}) to identify routers with a difference between the two simulations larger than a user defined threshold. In assumption case 3 with no baseline metrics to compare against we use solely router level PDA to classify nefarious routers.\par
  For comparison of classifiers under each case of assumptions we consider both a graphic and a numeric presentation of their performance. To evaluate the performance of each method we qualitatively compare the ROC curves produced by each classifier. For a quantitative comparison we consider three scenarios representing classifier use cases covering the spectrum of sensitivity and specificity requirements. These scenarios were selected as they allow us to evaluate the ROC curve at the upper right, middle, and lower left segments of the plot respectively: 
    \begin{description}[labelindent=1cm]
      \item[Scenario 1:] A false negative rate of < 10\% (sensitivity of 0.9)
      \item[Scenario 2:] A false negative rate < 30\%  and a false negative rate of < 50\% (sensitivity of 0.7 and specificity of 0.5)
      \item[Scenario 3:] A false positive rate of < 10\% (specificity of 0.1)
  \end{description}
  Scenario one represents a government network with a large budget and a low tolerance for unidentified compromised routers. Scenario two represents a budget restricted cloud provider with quality of service obligations around sensitivity and specificity of nefarious router detection. Scenario three represents an organisation monitoring a network of honeypot servers which wishes to avoid costly manual analysis of non-compromised machines.

\subsection{Probe Allocation}
\label{ssec:Mprobeallocation}
As probes traversing different nodes and different probes traversing the same node have an independent effect on $q$ we can develop an aggregation of all measurements in $\vec{q}$ assuming $r\in R, q_r \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \theta_r)$ where the variance $\theta_r$ is unknown. Using this this we aim to infer an estimation of $\vec{\theta}$ from our monitor-to-monitor measurements $\vec{q}$. To formalise our knowledge of the network from probing we adapt a standard PDV PMF from \cite{he_network_2021} where $\mathcal{M} = \sum_{r\in p}\theta_r$ in \cref{eq:pdvobservationmodel} and denote the corresponding log-likelihood function as $\widehat{\mathcal{L}}(q, p)$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pdvobservationmodel}
    f_{Q|\vec{\theta},\; \vec{\phi}}(q,\;p) = \phi_p \sqrt{2\pi\mathcal{M}}^{\ q^2/{2\mathcal{M}_r}}
\end{equation}
Using $\widehat{\mathcal{L}}(q, p)$ we are able to represent a network as a FIM, from this the CRB can be posed as a metric representing the lower bound on the accuracy of our inference, we elaborate on the specifics of this representation in \cref{sec:Mnetworkprobing}. Using this CRB however we can show that the equal allocation of probes over paths is a sub optimal approach to probing. Consider the example network in \cref{fig:fimex3routereg} we define three probe paths $p_0$, $p_1$, and $p_3$ traversing $r_0\rightarrow r_2$, $\ r_1\rightarrow r_2$, $\ r_0\rightarrow r_1\rightarrow r_2$, and the reserve directions respectively.

    \label{fig:fimex3routereg}
\end{figure}

We examine three different probe allocations between [$p_0,\:p_1$]: $\phi_0$ = [0.33, 0.33, 0.33],  $\phi_1$ = [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], and $\phi_2$ = [0.8, 0.1, 0.1]. As there are no nefarious routers each router has an equal expected true PDV, let these true PDV's be $r_0=1, r_1=1, r_2=1$, the CRB of each probe allocation is then $\phi_0$=2.69, $\phi_1$=5.97, $\phi_2$=5.97. Recalling that the CRB provides a lower bound on inferential accuracy, the equal allocation of probes between paths results in the lowest inferential accuracy, this also holds when nefarious behaviour is included.\par
Suppose the case of $r_1$ being nefarious with a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability of holding a packet any timestep, resulting in an increased PDV of 3 the CRB of each probing scheme is then $\phi_0$=1.51, $\phi_1$=4.24, $\phi_2$=2.05. Although each probing scheme performs worse it is clear that $\phi_0$ is comparatively even worse at detecting the increased PDV of the nefarious router than the case of no nefarious nodes. Note for comparison that in the previous case of being $r_1$ nefarious a pseudo optimal probing allocation $\phi_{optimal}$ = [0.0, 0.5, 0.5] results in a CRB of 33.67.

\subsection{Metric Normalisation}
\label{ssec:Mmetricnormilisation}
The packet delay delay distribution at a single router is a combination of the two contributors to it's buffer queue length:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \# of packets received each timestep.
    \item The \# of packets sent each timestep.
\end{enumerate}
For non-nefarious routers contributor \emph{2} is always a fixed rate of one packet per time step. If the router is nefarious this rate is $<1$ proportional to the router's hold probability. As the rate of sending is not impacted by contributor \emph{1} we hypothesise that accounting for variation of contributor \emph{1} between routers will enable more accurate inference of contributor \emph{2} and subsequently nefarious behaviour.\par
As \textit{traffic intensity} is constant across the network, contributor \emph{1} is proportional to the degree of each node. This is as the number of packets being received by a router each time step is the sum of packets received from each link. We therefore use $\forall r\in R, \sqrt{\gls{routerdeg}}$ for normalisation over delay.
